# Acquire-Analyze-Twitter

Part of Fall 2021 Text Mining Course as UM

The goal of this project was to pull the most recent Tweets through the Twitter API that have #Montana in them. With large sport games occuring in this state, as well as forest fires. I was interested in what Twitter users were saying in regards to Montana.

The data is aquired through API then analyized in the frame of Unigrams, Bigrams, basic statistics, and frequencies.
